                    <h4 class="heading">Passion </h4>
                <p>I was always enthusiastic about technologies from junior school. But later on that keen interest turned into an obsession to find more about the mechanic's, the working principle of these technologies. In the end, I summarized that every tech that exists to date uses electronics. Which then steered me towards getting a bachelors in electronics & electrical engineering.</p>
